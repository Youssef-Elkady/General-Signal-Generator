# General-Signal-Generator  
## General Signal Generator created using Matlab  
### types of signals supported are:  
1: DC signal  
2: Polynomial Signal     
3: Ramp signal    
4: Sinusoidal Signal    
5: Exponential Signal   
  
### User could then modify the signal in many ways such as:  
1: Scale the signal  
2: Reverse time of the signal  
3: Compressing signal  
4: Time shifting the signal    
5: Expanding the signal   
   
User is then allowed to display the new graph or exit the code.
